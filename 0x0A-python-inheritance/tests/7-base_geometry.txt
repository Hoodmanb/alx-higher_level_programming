# The `6-base_geometry.py` Module

## Class: `BaseGeometry`

### Overview
The `BaseGeometry` class is designed to serve as a base class for geometry-related functionality.

### Public Instance Method: `area`
- Raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented" to signal that this method should be implemented by subclasses.

```python
class BaseGeometry:
    """Public instance method: def area(self):
    that raises an Exception with the message area()
    is not implemented"""
    def area(self):
        """return exception"""
        raise Exception("area() is not implemented")
